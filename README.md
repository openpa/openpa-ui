# OpenPA Client UI

OpenPA Client UI is a modern chat interface for interacting with AI agents using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. It provides both desktop and web application modes for seamless agent communication.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Support**: Connect to and chat with multiple AI agents
- **Real-time Streaming**: Support for Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time responses
- **Dual Mode**: Run as either an Electron desktop app or a web application
- **Rich UI**: Built with Vue 3 and Element Plus for a polished user experience
- **Markdown Support**: Render formatted responses with syntax highlighting
- **Persistent Chat**: Save and restore conversation history
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize agent URL, model, temperature, and more
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Element Plus, Pinia
- **Desktop**: Electron with system tray support
- **Agent SDK**: @a2a-js/sdk for A2A protocol implementation
- **Markdown**: Marked with syntax highlighting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18+ recommended
- **npm** or **yarn**: Package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd openpa-client-ui
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and adjust settings if needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env_example .env
   ```

### Development

#### Desktop (Electron) Mode

Run the Electron app with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and launches the Electron window.

#### Web Mode

Run the web application with development server:

```bash
npm run web:dev
# or
yarn web:dev
```

Access the app at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown in console).

### Building

#### Build Desktop App

Build the Electron application (creates installer):

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The installer will be in the `release/` folder.

#### Web Development

For web application development with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run web:dev
# or
yarn web:dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:8000` with proxy support for `/a2a` requests.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Port for web server (default: 8000 for web mode, 0/random for Electron mode)
- `AGENT_URL`: Default A2A agent URL (default: http://localhost:10000)
- `VITE_AGENT_URL`: Agent URL loaded by Vite configs (currently loaded but not passed to client)

### Agent Configuration

In the app settings, you can configure:

- **Agent URL**: The endpoint of your A2A agent
- **Auto-connect**: Automatically connect to agent on startup
- **Theme**: Light or dark mode

## Usage

1. Launch the application (desktop or web)
2. Configure your agent URL in settings (default: `http://localhost:10000`)
3. Connect to the agent to view agent card information
4. Start chatting with the agent
5. View real-time thinking process, token usage, and latency metrics
6. Use the settings panel to customize agent URL, theme, and auto-connect behavior

## Development Tips

- The app detects whether it's running in Electron or web mode automatically
- In web dev mode, `/a2a` requests are proxied to the agent URL
- Chat history is stored in localStorage
- The SDK client is initialized dynamically based on the runtime mode
